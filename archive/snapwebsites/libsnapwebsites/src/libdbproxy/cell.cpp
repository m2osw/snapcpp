 *      Handling of cell. There is no class representing a row in Cassandra.
 *      A row is just a key. We have this object to allow for our C++ array
 *      syntax to access the Cassandra data.

/** \class cell
 * \brief A cell holds a name and value pair.
 *
 * A cell represents the value of a column in a row. The name of a cell
 * is the name of the corresponding column. The value is the data saved
 * in the Cassandra database.
 *
 * The name of the cell is kept as a binary key (it can be binary.) It
 * is limited it length to a little under 64Kb.
 *
 * Cells are loaded from the Cassandra database whenever the user
 * reads its value. Actually, the value is marked as cached once read
 * the first time. Each further access is done using the memory value
 * thus avoiding accessing the Cassandra server each time. Note that
 * may have some side effects if your process runs for a long time.
 * Use the cell, row, table, or context clearCache() functions to
 * palliate to this problem.
 *
 * Cells are saved to the Cassandra database whenever the user overwrite
 * its current value. In this case the cache is updated but the data is
 * non the less written to Cassandra except if the value was not modified
 * and the cache was marked as active.
