/** \brief Initialize the thread.
 *
 * This constructor initializes the thread runner with the specified
 * session and socket.
 *
 * It creates a thread named "connection" with the thread runner attached.
 *
 * It also keeps a copy of the socket so it can close it using its
 * destructor.
 *
 * The thread is then started. If anything fails, except the start, you
 * are likely to get an exception. Otherwise the is_running() will
 * return false which means that you should not keep a copy of that
