/** \class snapdbproxy_listener
 * \brief Handle new connections from clients.
 *
 * This function is an implementation of the snap server so we can
 * handle new connections from various clients.
 */



/** \brief The listener initialization.
 *
 * The listener receives a pointer back to the snap::server object and
 * information on how to generate the new network connection to listen
 * on incoming connections from clients.
 *
 * The server listens to two types of messages:
 *
 * \li accept() -- a new connection is accepted from a client
 * \li recv() -- a UDP message was received
 *
 * \param[in] s  The server we are listening for.
 * \param[in] addr  The address to listen on. Most often it is 127.0.0.1.
 * \param[in] port  The port to listen on.
 * \param[in] max_connections  The maximum number of connections to keep
 *            waiting; if more arrive, refuse them until we are done with
 *            some existing connections.
 * \param[in] reuse_addr  Whether to let the OS reuse that socket immediately.
