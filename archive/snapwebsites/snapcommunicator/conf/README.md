List of Services
================

The `snapcommunicator` reads files with the .service extension that are
defined in this directory as names of services that will connect to it
over time (as they get started.)

This is the complete list which is sent to the remote `snapcommunicator`
instances.

The files here are created by the `postinst` script of packages that
offer a service or services and removed by the `postrm` script. These
files are not expected to be created by hand, unless you are a
programmer running various tests.
