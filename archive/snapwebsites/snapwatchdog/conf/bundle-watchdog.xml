  <description>
    <p>The watchdog bundles installs various systems used to track
    what happens on your server. These daemons will determine the
    health of a system. If any part of a system breaks down, an
    alarm is raised and the administrator should check on it. Many
    parts are automatically worked on by killing a process and seeing
    that it restart. At a later time, we may also look into creating
    a new VPS automatically as a replacement of the whole server that's
    failing.</p>
    <p>Once installed you must enter a few parameters to ensure that
    the watchdog emails reach you. You also want to test that it works
    to make sure that the watchdog is indeed going to be useful. The
    Watchdog tab will include a "test_mta" field for that purpose.</p>
