  <package name="ntp" priority="25" installation="required">
    <description>
      The `ntp` package is required as you are running in a cluster
      and all the computer must have the same clock.

      Further, the `ntpdate` tool may run just at the time the `ntpd` server
      gets restarted. When that happens, the two tools fight for the
      same UDP port and in some cases the `ntpd` daemon can lose.
      When that happens, the `ntpd` daemon stops running. We strongly
      suggest that you remove the `ntpdate` package from your computer
      if it is installed.
