Description: Serialization Made Easy with Qt
 The libQtSerialization library is a Qt extension that makes it really easy to
 serialize your data in a forward and backward compatible way.
 The library is composed of two sides: the QWriter which helps you serialize
 data, and the QReader that helps you unserialize data.
 The writer is quiet straight forward. Pretty much, all you have to do is call
 a writeTag() function and the data gets serialized.
 The reader is a little more complex so the serialization can support special
 cases, especially sub-classes (so you can save a tree of classes) and array of
 classes (your tree may be composed of multiple instances of a given object.)
 .
 This is the development package.
