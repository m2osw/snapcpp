/** \class QReader
 * \brief This class is used to read data from a serialized buffer.
 *
 * This class accepts an input stream (read-only or read/write) and
 * converts it to data that fields can parse back the way it was when
 * saving this data.
 *
 * The reader can parse older and newer as well as current data. It
 * knows how to skip data that isn't known by the current implementation
 * making it a perfect choice for any data changes a lot between versions
 * and that needs to be serialized.
 *
 * As a user you are expected to call the read() function. Once the header
 * was read, you can then use the different version functions to check
 * what version the file is defined as.
 *
 * If an error occurs while reading, then the class throws an exception.
 * Including if a read from the input stream fails. If the read() function
 * returns as it then the read was 100% successful.
