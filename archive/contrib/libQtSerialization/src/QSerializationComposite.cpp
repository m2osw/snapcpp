 * \brief Initialize the composite type.

 * A composite type is a set of fields that are to be read
 * from serialized data. It is used as the parent of the
 * fields defined in that composite.
 */


/** \brief Add a field to this composite.
 *
 * Call this function whenever you create a field in a
 * composite.
 *
 * Fields are added to a map which has the side effect of
 * sorting the fields in "alphabetical" order (the order
 * is really using the binary code of each character and
 * the locale is totally ignored.)
 *
 * Note that the composite keeps a reference to your field
 * so you may change it with time, however, you should
 * not delete the field before the composite it was added
 * into.
 *
 * \exception QExceptionAlreadyDefined
 * This exception is raised when you call this function
 * twice with the same name. Two fields cannot make use of the
 * same name. Arrays make use the QFieldTag which runs one of
 * your functions over and over again so you can create as many
 * children as required.
 *
 * \param[in] name  The name of this field as it appears in the serialized file.
 * \param[in] field  The field to add to the composite.
