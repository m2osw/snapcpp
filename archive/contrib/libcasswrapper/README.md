# Introduction

The `libcasswrapper` library is a light wrapper around the Cassandra
CPP Driver.

The library is implemented with C++ in mind. The Cassandra CPP Driver,
sadly, is really NOT C++, but straight C. All of the resources handles
returned are not managed with constructors/destructors to deal with
object lifetime. The developer is responsible to make sure resources
are properly destroyed once he/she is finished with them. This opens
up the door to memory and resource leaks.

In order to avoid those pitfalls, we've written a thin C++ "wrapper"
around the driver API itself. The resource handles are preserved in
smart pointers, which automatically manage the lifetimes and prevent
resource leaks. This makes the library a lot easier to use in an
object oriented situation, consistent with the tried and true design
principle of RAII.


# Compiling

In order to compile the library, you need the `cmake` extensions from
the Snap! C++ environment. We provide that file in GitHub as
a tarball. Just extract along with the library.

You also need to have the Cassandra CPP Driver C-API in order to
communicate with the library. The setup of this driver is outside
the scope of this document, but if you run under Centos, Ubuntu
or Windows, there are binary drivers here:

See documentation here:

`libcasswrapper` uses Doxygen markup to provide developer documentation.
If you wish to extract the docs, you have to have Doxygen installed
before you run the `cmake` command.

Once you extracted the `.tar.gz` files you do something like this:

    mkdir BUILD
    cd BUILD
    cmake ../libcasswrapper
    make
    make install


# What's next?

Although we have wrapped most of the core functionality of the CPP driver,
there is still some API which is not wrapped. As time goes on, we will
add more and more support. Still, you should have enough to handle the
basic tasks of interfacing with the Cassandra database.
