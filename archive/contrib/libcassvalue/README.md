# Introduction

The `libcassvalue` library provides a single class and support functions
which allow conversion/storage of a piece of data. It is somewhat reminiscent
of Qt's `QVariant`. All data is stored in a `QByteArray`, but there are various
conversion functions allowing one to convert from `QByteArray` to different C++
types (e.g. `int32_t`, `uint64_t`, `QString`, etc.).

You can find additional information about the project, which is connected to
Snap! Websites [reference manual](https://snapwebsitess.org/project/references).
