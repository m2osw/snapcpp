 * Compile, Build, Install

This project uses cmake to generate the Makefile necessary to build the
project:

   tar xf libQtCassandra-0.5.0.tar.gz
   mkdir BUILD
   cd BUILD
   cmake ../libQtCassandra-0.5.0
   make
   [sudo] make install

This should work on all Unices. We have not yet worked on the project to
get it to function under MS-Windows.


 * Thrift (see README.txt for more info)

If you have an uncompatible (?!) version of thrift or Cassandra, you may
need to regenerate the thrift-gencpp-cassandra directory. This is done
with:

   thrift --gencpp <path to cassandra>/interface/cassandra.thrift

The output will go in a directory named gencpp by default. You'll want to
rename the directories, and copy the CMakeLists.txt file in your new
directory. Also, I made a few changes marked with "Snap! Websites" (you
can search on that string!) so it compiles in my environment. It is likely
that you'll also need those additional #include because the default integer
type extensions are not available as is.
