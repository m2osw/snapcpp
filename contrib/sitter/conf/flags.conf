# Project Sitter Configuration File for the Flags Extension
#
# The file is a basic list of variables "name = value"
#
# Comments start with a # character, must be the first character after spaces
# Empty lines are ignored
#
# DO NOT EDIT
#
# Instead create a file under
#
#    /etc/sitter/sitter.d/50-flags.conf
#


# path=<path>
#
# Whenever a flag is raised, it saves a file with the flag data in this
# directory.
#
# Default: /var/lib/sitter/flags
#path=/var/lib/sitter/flags


# vim: wrap
