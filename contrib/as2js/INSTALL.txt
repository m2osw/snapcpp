  . tar xf as2js.tar.gz
  . mkdir BUILD
  . cd BUILD
  . cmake ../as2js-0.1.0      # fix version as required
  . make
  . sudo make install

cmake can be tweaked with different flags as follow:

	-DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH:PATH=/home/snapwebsites/BUILD/dist/share/cmake-3.5/Modules \
	../as2js

You may also change the installation path to /usr to install in the standard
Unix environment.
